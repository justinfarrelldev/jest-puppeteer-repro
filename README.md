# Purpose

This is a simple reproduction repo for an issue reported with `jest-puppeteer`. To see the issue, open the folder in an IDE and `yarn install`. 

# Observations

I set this up with `npm` before `yarn`, and `npm` seems to work fine. Is this maybe something to do with the way it is packaged in `yarn` specifically?
